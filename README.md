## Description
The Wag Club is a Django-powered web application built to make life easier for both dog parents and the people who care for their pups. Instead of dealing with scribbled notes, lost paper passes, or “did I use that voucher already?” moments, everything is handled digitally — clean, simple, and secure.

Customers can browse daycare passes, grooming packages, and special offers, then buy them through a smooth checkout experience. Every purchase instantly generates a unique voucher with its own expiry date and QR code, so owners can redeem their passes on-site with a quick scan. Their personal wallet keeps everything neatly organised in one place, making it easy to see what’s active, what’s expiring soon, and what’s already been used.

Behind the scenes, the platform gives staff all the tools they need to run the business smoothly: managing services and prices, issuing and redeeming vouchers, checking histories, and keeping everything consistent without spreadsheets or guesswork. It’s powered by Django, PostgreSQL, and Stripe, with a responsive front-end that stays true to the soft, friendly Wag Club brand.

The end result feels like a modern companion for a real dog-care business — something that cuts down admin, keeps customers informed, and brings a bit of joy into the process with clean design and puppy energy.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

1. **Clone & install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` from the template**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update the Stripe keys with test credentials and, if you plan to use Postgres locally, set `DATABASE_URL`.

3. **Apply migrations & run the server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

With `DEBUG=True` (the default in `.env.example`), the project uses SQLite and will start with permissive hosts (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`).

## Configuration Reference

Key environment variables expected by the app:

- **SECRET_KEY**: Django secret key (a safe default is provided for local dev; override in production).
- **DEBUG**: `True` for local development; set to `False` in production.
- **ALLOWED_HOSTS / CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS**: Comma-separated lists for deployment.
- **DATABASE_URL**: Postgres connection string (required when `DEBUG=False`).
- **Stripe**: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_API_KEY` (restricted key), `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK`.
- **Email**: `EMAIL_BACKEND` (defaults to console), host, port, TLS, credentials, and `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`.
- **Cloudinary**: `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` (optional for local runs).

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The Wag Club MVP is a focused, practical web application that delivers the essential digital tools a dog daycare & grooming business needs to operate smoothly — without unnecessary complexity. It replaces manual tracking with a streamlined system where customers can purchase passes, view their vouchers, and redeem them using auto-generated QR codes.

At its core, the MVP does three things exceptionally well:

1. Sell services and passes
Users can browse daycare passes, grooming options, and special offers, then complete purchases through a Stripe-ready checkout flow.

2. Generate and manage vouchers
Every purchase creates a unique, secure voucher with an expiry date, QR code, and a clear status (active, redeemed, or expired). Customers can view all their vouchers from a simple “My Wallet” dashboard.

3. Support smooth in-store redemption
Staff can scan or manually check voucher codes to validate them instantly, reducing mistakes and removing the need for paper tracking.

The MVP focuses on real business value: clarity, automation, and reliability. With Django, PostgreSQL, and a clean branded UI, The Wag Club delivers the minimum lovable product a real dog-care service could use today — offering customers a modern digital experience while keeping operations effortless for the staff.

## Testing
Tests are run with `python manage.py test` (uses the test SQLite DB). Current coverage includes:

- Checkout session creation flow and Stripe metadata injection (`orders.tests.OrderViewsTests`).
- Stripe webhook order/voucher creation with QR generation for cart items.
- Success view display without duplicating orders, and voucher access control.
- Service listing populates Passes/Packages/Offers categories (`services.tests.ServiceListViewTests`).
